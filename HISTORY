NOTE: this library was first written probably between 1995 to 1998
I separated it out of the 'aplot' program on 4/6/2002, and thus begins
its changelog:

4/6/02
    - integrated the libmtm.a code into this library.  This means that
        linking with -lg2c and a fortran compiler are necessary.
    - changed the interface: create_sonogram() now does not accept
        any parameters.  One uses the sonogram_setopts() to set the
        fftsize, overlap, and nsamples parameters.  
        Setting the fftsize is required.  However, one can change it
        arbitrarily often.
        Setting the overlap is required if one intends to generate
        a sonogram: i.e., power-spectral densities at serial time
        slices through a large number of samples.  In this case, it
        is also necessary to set the total number of samples.
        For now, see the aplot_sono.c file for how to do this.
        The library can cache the time slices, so they won't be
        recomputed if asked for again.   This caching will be on-disk,
        so very large files can be handled.
    - data in ring buffers is now supported nicely.  One simply tells
        libsono that the buffers are ring buffers, and call
        calculate_psd instead of calculate_psd_cached/uncached.
    - added simple versioning system
    - libsono now installs into /usr/local/lib/libsono.a and
        /usr/local/include/sonogram.h
    - Fixed the mtm code - mtm spectra now work, but take noticeably
        longer to generate, and so may not be appropriate for real-time
        use (right now).

4/19/02
    - changed from including values.h to float.h.  values.h isn't available
        on Apple OS/X, while float.h is on both. (Thanks to Donour Sizemore
        donour@uchicago.edu) for the bug report.

4/27/02
    - Added support (toggled by an #ifdef in sonogram.c) for a C language
        version of multitapering, that is taken from the GRASP package
        and modified.  It's based on the Percival and Walden book. so I
        sort of know what's going on... 
    - Fixed the normalization for MTM.
    - Select the C or Fortran MTM code by commenting in/out the appropriate
        parts of the Makefile...
    - Note that for the C code, only the MTM # windows and MTM bandwidth
        settings in aplot are used...  Of course, the fortran code didn't
        really use any of the others either, for the most part.
    - libsono is now GPL.  I have the copyright on sonogram.*, and parts
        of mem.c and multitaper.c.  However, the FFT code is
        copyright 1990  Richard H. Krukar all rights reserved
        but is free to redistribute, and the Fortran MTM code is
        (c) 1996 Michael Mann (http://www.people.virginia.edu/~mem6u),
        and free to redistribute, and the C MTM code is
        (c) 1997,1998 Bruce Allen (GRASP), and free to redistribute, and
        there are several routines taken from or derived from
        Numerical Recipes:
        portions (C) Copr. 1986-92 Numerical Recipes Software #.3.
        Note: my code is mainly just glue and interface stuff.
    - Now, MEM and MTM spectra use boxcar windows regardless of what
        window function the user asks for.

6/13/03
    - fixed fftw support. It works with fftw-2.1.3 on my system, when
        the application built with this library is linked with librfftw.a.
    - modified the LIBSONO_MAXFFTSIZE parameter to support FFT sizes
        up to 65536 samples (this increases the sizes of allocated arrays
        a whole lot, though).  I'll need to optimize the memory usage at
        some point.
    - modified the makefile to enable FFTW support by default.
    - remember to make install this library and to rebuild all applications
        that use it.

12/8/05
    - updated fftw support to support fftw3.  It no longer supports fftw2.
        Applications built with libsono should be linked with -lfftw3.
        There are RPM packages for linux, etc.
