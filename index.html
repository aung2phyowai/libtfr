        <p>Libtfr is a library for calculating multi-taper conventional and time-frequency reassignment (TFR) spectrograms.</p>

<p>Mainly for readability. Compare the conventional windowed spectrogram on the right with the reassignment spectrogram on the right.</p>

<p>The spectral energy distribution is much sparser in the second image, and it's easier to see the high-frequency trill (the tone that's rapidly modulated up and down) right in the middle of the sound. For some applications, reassignment spectrograms can provide much more precise measurements.</p>

<p>It's important to note that no signal processing tricks can do away with the fundamental tradeoff in time-frequency <em>resolution</em>. In the images above, the trill gets close enough to the lower-frequency tonal component that the two start to smear together. Spectral resolution can only be increased by increasing the size of the analysis window, which reduces temporal resolution.</p>

<ul>
<li>It's fast. The library is written on top of the <a href="http://www.fftw.org">FFTW</a> library, one of the fastest Fourier transformation libraries, and the library itself is in lightweight C99 code. On a reasonably modern processor, libtfr can calculate a multitaper reassignment spectrogram in 1/2 to 1/4 of the duration of the signal, making it usable for realtime applications.</li>
<li>It's convenient. The library is well-documented and comes with python and MATLAB interfaces.</li>
<li>It's free (as in speech)</li>
</ul>
