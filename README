    4.  REQUIREMENTS
    ----------------
        To compile, libsono requires:
            gcc
            g77 (if you select the fortran version of MTM in the Makefile)
            FFTW (unless you disable this in the Makefile)

        You can get FFTW at the following website: http://www.fftw.org/
        Note that version 2 fftw is currently required (version 3 is
        incompatible with version 2 and is not yet supported). 
        Note also that if you are building the fftw 2 library from sources,
        the default configuration is to *not* build the shared libraries.
        Please see the FFTW documentation for how to over-ride this, if
        so desired.

        In the past, libsono has been compiled on SunOS, Solaris, Digital
        UNIX, and even VMS.  However, it has changed much since then.
        Right now, it should compile with minimal required changes on just
        about any modern Unix or Unix-like system.  I have not tried using
        the cygwin environment.


    5.  INSTALL
    -----------
        The following should work (:->):
            $ make clean
            $ make depend
            $ make
            $ make install


    6.  FIRST-TIME USAGE
    --------------------
        

    7.  FAQ
    -------
        1) What wacky indent style did you use?
            Hey, I have very large monitors, and like small fonts.
            I don't care if my code is more than 80 chars wide.
            I really dislike:
                for (i=0; i < 10; i++) {
                    /* do something */
                }
            I really prefer:
                for (i=0; i < 10; i++)
                {
                    /* do something */
                }
            I use 4 character width tabs.  
            And by the way, vile/xvile is the editor of kings.

    8.  THEORY OF OPERATION
    -----------------------
        <under construction>

        libsono is not multi-thread safe...

        somewhat:

        especially multitapering methods:
